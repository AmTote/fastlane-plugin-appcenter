[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/microsoft/fastlane-plugin-appcenter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/microsoft/fastlane-plugin-appcenter)

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-appcenter`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin appcenter
```

fastlane v2.96.0 or higher is required for all plugin-actions to function properly.

## About App Center
With [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) you can continuously build, test, release, and monitor your apps. This plugin provides a set of actions to interact with App Center.

`appcenter_fetch_devices` allows you to obtain the list of iOS devices to distribute an app to (useful for automatic provisioning of testers' devices).

`appcenter_upload` allows you to upload and [distribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/uploading) apps to your testers on App Center as well as to upload .dSYM files to [collect detailed crash reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/crashes/ios) in App Center.

`appcenter_fetch_version_number` allows you to obtain the latest version number (short or full) and release notes for an app. This is useful for tasks such as getting the latest version of an app so that an increment action can take place on CI, or checking that an upload has been successful.

`appcenter_fetch_app` allows you to obtain the details of the given app. This is useful for retrieving the app_secret for a specific App Center app.

`appcenter_create_app` allows you to create an app without uploading a release for it.  Supports "create if not exists" semantics. This is useful for retrieving an app_secret before building an app.

`appcenter_codepush_release_react` allows you to deploy app updates via CodePush.

## Usage

To get started, first, [obtain an API token](https://appcenter.ms/settings/apitokens) in App Center. The API Token is used to authenticate with the App Center API in each call.

```ruby
appcenter_fetch_devices(
  api_token: "<appcenter token>",
  owner_name: "<appcenter account name of the owner of the app (username or organization URL name)>",
  app_name: "<appcenter app name>",
  destinations: "*", # Default is 'Collaborators', use '*' for all distribution groups
  devices_file: "devices.txt" # Default. If you customize, the extension must be .txt
)
```

```ruby
appcenter_upload(
  api_token: "<appcenter token>",
  owner_name: "<appcenter account name of the owner of the app (username or organization URL name)>",
  owner_type: "user", # Default is user - set to organization for appcenter organizations
  app_name: "<appcenter app name (as seen in app URL)>",
  file: "<path to android build binary>",
  notify_testers: true # Set to false if you don't want to notify testers of your new release (default: `false`)
)
```

```ruby
appcenter_fetch_version_number(
  api_token: "<appcenter token>",
  owner_name: "<appcenter account name of the owner of the app (username or organization URL name)>",
  app_name: "<appcenter app name (as seen in app URL)>",
  version: "a specific version to get the last release for" # optional, don't set this value to get the last upload of all versions
)
```

The `appcenter_fetch_version_number` returns a hash that contains the id, the version number, the build number, and the release notes of the most recent release. 
The version corresponds to the `short_version` and the build number to the `version` known by App Center for a given release:
```ruby
{"id"=>1, "version"=>"1.0.0", "build_number"=>"1.0.0.1234", "release_notes"=>"Release version 1.0.0"} # iOS apps contain the full version plus build number due to the way that Apple use CFBundleVersion for this value
{"id"=>588, "version"=>"1.2.0", "build_number"=>"1615", "release_notes"=>"No changelog given"}
```

```ruby
appcenter_fetch_app(
  api_token: "<appcenter token>",
  owner_name: "<appcenter account name of the owner of the app (username or organization URL name)>",
  app_name: "<appcenter app name (as seen in app URL)>"
)
```

```ruby
appcenter_create_app(
  api_token: "<appcenter token>",
  owner_name: "<appcenter account name of the owner of the app (username or organization URL name)>",
  owner_type: "user", # Default is user - set to organization for appcenter organizations
  app_name: "<appcenter app name (as seen in app URL)>",
  app_display_name: "<appcenter app display name>",
  app_os: "<appcenter app os>",
  app_platform: "<appcenter app platform>",
  error_on_create_existing: false # Set to false if you don't want to error if the release already exists (default: `true`)
)
```
All fields except 'error_on_create_existing' are required. 

THe `appcenter_create_app` action creates an App Center app with the given attributes and 
returns a hash of the newly created app with generated values.  

If the app already exists, action aborts with error.  

If the 'error_on_create_existing' is set to false, an existing app will not error and instead return the app hash unchanged.

```ruby
appcenter_codepush_release_react(
  api_token: "<appcenter token>",
  owner_name: "<appcenter account name of the owner of the app (username or organization URL name)>",
  app_name: "<appcenter app name (as seen in app URL)>",
  deployment: "Staging"
)
```

### Help

Once installed, information and help for an action can be printed out with this command:

```bash
fastlane action appcenter_upload # or any action included with this plugin
```

### A note on App Name

The `app_name` and `owner_name` as set in the Fastfile come from the app's URL in App Center, in the below form:
```
https://appcenter.ms/users/{owner_name}/apps/{app_name}
```
They should not be confused with the displayed name on App Center pages, which is called `app_display_name ` instead.

### Parameters

The action parameters `api_token`, `owner_name`, `app_name`, and others can also be omitted when their values are [set as environment variables](https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/#environment-variables). By default, `appcenter_upload` will use the same `api_token`, `owner_name`, and `app_name` you used in `appcenter_fetch_devices`.

## Example

Check out this [example `Fastfile`](fastlane/Fastfile) to see how to use the `appcenter_upload` action. Try it by cloning the repo, running `fastlane install_plugins` and `bundle exec fastlane test`.

Sample uses `.env` for setting private variables like API token, owner name, .etc. You need to replace it in `Fastfile` by your own values.

There are three examples in `test` lane:
- upload release for android with minimum required parameters
- upload release for ios with all set parameters
- upload only dSYM file for ios

Check out this [example `Fastfile`](fastlane/fetch_devices/Fastfile) for a full example of fetching devices, registering them with Apple, provisioning the devices, and signing an app.

## Run tests for this plugin
